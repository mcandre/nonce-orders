## INTRODUCTION

The forces of good and evil wage constant war upon the earth, steering it just outside of Hell, and at times skirting past Heaven. While you and your adversaries lean philosophically one way or the other, you come to the mutual conclusion that life is good, that its myriad variations makes it far more enjoyable than the final absolute of life in Heaven or Hell. Your enlightened views are quite outside the norm, for most it is accepted as bare fact that earth would be better off under rule by one side or the other. Each is Hell-or Heaven-bent on assuming power once and for all.

If the battle between good and evil ever reaches Apocalypse, however, the ensuing cataclysm will ruin earth's priveleged sanctuary status, destroying all life in the nine losing circles of Heaven or Hell, as well as all life on earth. To win the game of Nonce Orders is to maintain earth's neutrality, by issuing enough angelic and demonic orders onto earth to appease the Higher Powers while cleverly avoiding escalation to a full-scale Apocalypse.
