# INTRODUCTION

The forces of Good and Evil wage constant war upon the earth, shifting it just outside of complete control under Evil, swinging back at times almost completely purified by Good. While you and your adversaries lean philosophically one way or the other, you come to the mutual conclusion that life is grand, that its myriad variations life on earth far more enjoyable than the final absolute of Good or Evil control. Your enlightened views are quite outside the norm; For most souls, it is accepted as bare fact that earth would be better off under rule by one side or the other. Each force is Hell- or Heaven-bent on assuming power once and for all.

If the battle between Good and Evil ever reaches Apocalypse, however, the ensuing cataclysm will destroy all life on the losing circles of Good or Evil, as well as revoking earth's privileged sanctuary status, obliterating all remaining life on earth. To win the game is to maintain earth's neutrality, by issuing enough angelic and demonic Nonce Orders to appease the Higher Powers while cleverly avoiding escalation to a full-scale Apocalypse.

# GAMEPLAY OVERVIEW

One player assumes the role of an angelic General tasked with purging the earth of the forces of Evil. Another player assumes the role of a demonic General tasked with corrupting the earth against the forces of Good.

Players alternate drawing cards, completing orders issued by their corresponding Higher Powers, while strategically avoiding a final Apocalypse. As the forces of Good and Evil clash on earth, they cancel each other out, with their souls leaving the battlefield.

# GAME OBJECTIVES

Players attempt to finish the game with an equal number of forces on each side. When the Deck is empty, the current player takes his or her turn as normal, with one last chance to even the fight. If the number of cards on the sides of Good and Evil is perfectly matched, both players win.

Players also strive to finish each turn without upsetting the balance of Good vs Evil by too much. As long as each player turn ends with a difference no greater than 3 cards, both players continue playing until the Deck is empty.

If both of these conditions is satisfied, then both players end their military shifts victoriously, maintaining earth's sanctuary status.

If, however, one of these conditions is not met, the majority-card force conquers earth, and both players lose.

# GAMEPLAY IN-DEPTH

## Nonce Orders Deck

The Nonce Orders Deck consists of five types of cards. For the nonce, these can be proxied by using Magic: The Gathering basic lands (Angel = Plains, Demon = Swamp, Spirit = Island, Devil = Mountain, Inspector = Forest), or by cards from other games, or index cards.

The 70 card Deck consists of 20 Angels and 20 Demons, 10 Spirits and 10 Devils, and 10 Inspectors.

## Game Setup

1. The Deck is shuffled then placed face down in the middle of the table.
2. Players decide on alliances: One player represents Good; the other represents Evil.
3. Players begin the game by each drawing a hand of 7 cards.
4. The Evil player takes his or her turn first, because Evil strikes out of nowhere.
5. Players alternate turn-by-turn.
6. The game is won or lost per GAME OBJECTIVES.

## Turn-by-Turn

A player begins his or her turn by drawing 3 cards from the top of the Deck, or as many as possible if the Deck is too low.

During the current player's turn, he or she plays Fighting Orders from the hand onto the table.

* Players may discuss hand composition to enhance cooperation.
* All allied **Special Forces** must be played. Opposing **Special Forces** may be kept in the hand.
* Allied and opposing **Troops** may be individually played onto the table or kept in the hand at the player's discretion.
* The player must end the turn with no more than 7 Orders remaining in hand.
* Inspectors impose additional strictions according to Neutral Orders.

At the end of the turn, cards cancel each other out according to Fighting Orders. Any leftover forces swing the battle towards Good or Evil, risking game loss according to GAME OBJECTIVES.

## Fighting Orders

**Troops:** Angels (Good) and Demons (Evil)
**Special Forces:** Spirits (Good) and Devils (Evil)

Fighting Orders constitute the main of the Deck. Fighting Orders are played from the hand onto the table over the course of the game. At the end of each player turn, each pair of Angel and Demon cancels out, and each pair of Spirit and Devil cancels out. Discard the pairs.

Players will want to delay Fighting Orders as long as possible, for completing too many Fighting Orders in one turn may result in a game loss (see GAME OBJECIVES).

## Neutral Orders

The presence of an Inspector in a player's hand indicates the player is being carefully monitored by his or her Higher Powers.

While an Inspector is in hand, the player must:

* Play all allied Fighting Orders, not just allied **Special Forces**.
* Discard all opposing Fighting Orders.
* Avoid all discussion of either player's hand composition.

The current player may Discard an Inspector. If so, the other player immediately draws 3 cards.

## Discard

To discard a card, either from the hand or the table, move the card to a face up Discard Pile next to the Deck.
